                Last Updated: February 10,2020 
                Who we are: 
                Hatch Credit Solutions, Inc. (Formerly Credit Starter, Inc.), (“Credit Starter,” “we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protected your privacy. When you use our services, you’ll share some information with us that could be used to identify you or that is associated with information that identifies you (“Personal Information”). Our goal is to clearly inform you about the Personal Information we collect, how we use it, and whom we share it with. This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that we gather or collect via our website or app or in connection with our services (collectively, the “Services”). The Services are more fully described in the Terms of Use, and such description is incorporated herein. It does not apply to any Personal Information collected by third party websites not operated by us. 
                By using, accessing or interacting with our Services, you are agreeing to our Terms of Use and consenting to how we collect, share and otherwise use information about you as described in this Privacy Policy. You may also email us at michael@hatch.credit with any privacy-related questions you have. 
                The information we collect: 
                There are three basic categories of information we collect: 
                • Personal Information you provide to us 
                • Automatically-collected data 
                • Information we get from third parties 
                Personal Information you provide to us 
                We may collect Personal Information that you choose to share with us. For example, when you set up an account, we need to collect important details about you, such as your name, phone number, date of birth, unique username, location, social security number, and email address. We may also collect any communications between you and Credit Starter and any other information you provide to Credit Starter. We also collect Personal Information when you register for or inquire about our Services, and when you use our Services. 
                Automatically-collected data 
                We, and our third-party partners, collect certain Personal Information automatically when you visit our website, read our e-mails, access or use our Services, or otherwise engage with us. This information is typically collected through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, file information, and other technology (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”). We, and our third-party partners, use these Tracking Technologies and other tools to automatically collect usage and device information, such as: 
                • Your IP address, location, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your account, your internet service provider, and other such information. 
                • We also collect information about the way you use or access our Services, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Services, whether you open e-mails or click the links contained in e-mails, whether you access the Services from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Services. 
                • When you access our Services from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (“IDFA”), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address. 
                Do Not Track Signals. We are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time. If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies and you may not be able to block non-cookie technologies and these browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques. You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it. Deleting cookies does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5. You can learn more about Flash objects—including how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies—on Adobe’s website. If you choose to delete Flash objects from our sites, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the sites or benefit from the information and services offered.

                We may also use non-personally identifiable information that does not personally identify you, including by aggregating and/or de-identifying Personal Information, in order to understand better how our visitors use the Services, research our visitors’ demographics, interests, and behavior, improve the Services, provide visitors with customized services and information, and for other similar purposes.

                Third party tracking and online advertising: 
                We may participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history or other information. We may share or we may permit third-party services to collect information about your use of our website over time so that they may play or display ads on our website, online platform or in connection with our Service, on other devices you may use, and on other websites, apps, or services. Typically, though not always, the information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the site, and other information. A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services, including helping us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. 
                We, or our third-party partners, may link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. We do this by collecting information about each device you use when you are logged in to our Service. We may also work with third-party partners who employ tracking technologies or the application of statistical modeling tools to determine if two or more devices are linked to a single user or household. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) with third-party advertising partners to help recognize you across devices. We, and our partners, can use this cross-device linkage to serve interest-based advertising and other personalized content to you across your devices, to perform analytics, and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns. 
                We may use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our site or Service on your browser or mobile device, log in to your account on our Service, or otherwise engage with us. We may share a unique identifier, like a user ID or hashed email address, with Google to facilitate the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Service and to tailor our advertisements and content to you. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google's site “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at 
                www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On here https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. 
                Please review the section title ‘Your choices’ below to understanding your choices regarding third party tacking and online advertising. 
                How long we keep your information: 
                We will retain your information for as long as you use our Services, to resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, enforce our agreements, comply with applicable laws or as long as we otherwise deem appropriate. We also maintain your Personal Information as part of our standard backup procedures. 
                Links to Other’s Sites and Services: 
                Our Services may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Services. These websites are operated by third parties not controlled by us, and by linking to them or being linked from them, we do not endorse, approve or make any representations about third-party websites or domains. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every website and domain that you interact with. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or domains and you visit them at your own risk. 
                Social Media: 
                Our Services may contain links and interactive features with various social media platforms. If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our Services. You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible social media platform, blog, or chat room, or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We have no control over such uses of your information when interacting with a social media platform, forums or otherwise online and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties. 
                How we store and protect your Personal Information: 
                Data storage and transfer: Your information collected through our Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Credit Starter or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities or otherwise stores information. If you are located in other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. In addition, information collected about you may be stored using cloud-based services. Information stored in the cloud may be maintained by third-party networks in locations in which such third-party networks operate or maintain data storage or processing facilities. 
                Keeping your information safe: We care about the security of your information and employ physical, administrative, and technological safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through our Service. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot 
                guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and, where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations. 
                Your choices: 
                If you receive commercial email from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email. You may also opt-out from receiving commercial email from us by sending us an email or by writing to us at the email address given at the end of this policy. You will continue to receive transaction-related emails regarding products or services you have requested. We may also send you certain communications regarding us and you will not be able to opt out of those communications (e.g., communications regarding updates to our Privacy Policy). 
                You have choices regarding our use and disclosure of your Personal Information. Depending on your location and subject to applicable law, you may have the following rights with regard to the Personal Information we control about you: (i) the right to request confirmation of whether we processes Personal Information relating to you, and if so, to request a copy of that Personal Information; (ii) the right to request that we rectify or update your Personal Information that is inaccurate, incomplete or outdated; (iii) the right to request that we erase your Personal Information in certain circumstances provided by law; (iv) the right to request that we restrict the use of your Personal Information in certain circumstances; and (v) the right to request that we export to another company, where technically feasible, your Personal Information that we hold in order to provide Services to you. Where the processing of your Personal Information is based on your previously given consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. To exercise your rights set forth in this paragraph, you must contact us at the email address set forth at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will comply with your request to the extent required by applicable law. We will not be able to respond to a request if we no longer hold your Personal Information or we are otherwise not required by law to respond to a request. 
                Cookies and Flash cookies. Most browsers allow you to adjust your browser settings to: (i) notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Blocking or deleting cookies may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly. Deleting cookies does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5. To manage Flash cookie settings and preferences, you must use the settings manager on Adobe’s website. If you choose to delete Flash objects from our Service, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the Service or benefit from the information and services offered. 
                Interest-based advertising. To learn about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI) online resources at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices and/or the DAA’s resources at www.aboutads.info/choices. Cross-device linking. Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI’s and DAA’s online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest- based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use. 
                Mobile advertising. You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking” (iOS) or “opt-out of interest based ads” (Android). You may also be able to opt-out of some—but not all—interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. 
                Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again. 
                Changes to this Privacy Policy 
                We may modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect the changes in our business and practices, so you should review this page periodically. When we change the policy in a material manner, we will let you know and update the ‘last updated’ date at the top of this page. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use our Services after we publish changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.
